# Migration knowledge

Gotchas/decisions for evolving LD off Vercel+Supabase onto VPS+SQLite. Plan + status:
`.issues/vps-migration.md`.

## Pages
- [build-and-deploy-gotchas.md](./build-and-deploy-gotchas.md) — pnpm lockfile discipline,
  the adapter-node swap fallout (deps/devDeps bucketing, rollup bump, `@types/node` dedup),
  and the local-build/boot loop.
- [svelte-5-runes-migration.md](./svelte-5-runes-migration.md) — M2c: running the runes codemod
  headlessly (the interactive CLI hangs; per-file Node driver + 30s timeout), the hand-fixes it
  can't do (`@migration-task`, `ComponentProps<typeof X>`, `$page.`→`page.` markup gap, email
  `svelte/server` render port, legacy-slot↔runes-snippet interop / Slideover conversion), why
  `bind:value={item.member}` is NOT `each_item_invalid_assignment`, driving warnings down via
  `compilerOptions.warningFilter`, runtime regression verification, and why eslint isn't a gate yet.
- [eslint-custom-config-and-runes-finish.md](./eslint-custom-config-and-runes-finish.md) — LD-A2:
  replacing antfu with the example's hand-written flat config (eslint 10 / svelte-plugin 3); why
  `lint:fix` churns ~125 files harmlessly; finishing the runes migration of the legacy stragglers to
  reach 0 lint errors (svelte-pieces slot/event conversion, the `state`/`$state` clash, `untrack`-ing a
  self-referential `$effect`, typing a JS action's custom event, `ban-types` removal, `{#each}` key
  conventions); the re-enabled pre-commit hook.
- [m4-sqlite-read-layer.md](./m4-sqlite-read-layer.md) — M4 read: replacing the M1 Supabase stub's
  READ path with server better-sqlite3 (`shared.db` catalog + per-dict `dictionaries/{id}.db` entries
  via a bundle endpoint feeding the Orama worker). Why LD's seam differs from house's reader port
  (client stub + search worker), the catalog/entries projections to legacy shapes, the confirmed
  adapter-node `dependencies` gotcha, the "only 4 of 2136 dbs have entries" data finding (+ `VACUUM
  INTO` seeding), keeping achi-flow unchanged by seeding fixtures into `achi.db`, the e2e harnesses
  + their external-error filtering, and what intentionally stays on the stub until auth/M4-write.
- [m4-write-sync.md](./m4-write-sync.md) — M4 write/sync: the browser wa-sqlite per-dict DB +
  SharedWorker + bidirectional sync. LD's design (wa-sqlite = client source of truth, Orama fed from
  it, saves to wa-sqlite); the main-thread-orchestrated Orama feed (worker boundary); the editor write
  path + interim double-write; **two latent sync bugs found + fixed (also in the example):** the
  `INSERT OR REPLACE` trigger failing under an UPSERT (fixed via `ON CONFLICT(key)` in a new
  migration) and the `/changes` fast-bail dropping editor pushes; OPFS→MemoryVFS fallback inside the
  SharedWorker (round-trip still works via sync-from-null); public snapshot endpoint (no R2; GCS
  stays); the self-sufficient seed; how to debug SharedWorker fetch/console (invisible to puppeteer).
- [m4-real-auth.md](./m4-real-auth.md) — M4 auth: porting the example's `AuthUser`/`ssr_user`/
  `dict_roles` model (full port) with two pragmatic LD adaptations (plain `page.data.admin` mirror;
  plain role booleans wrapped in `readable()` only for the search store); the legacy `getSession`
  JWT shim kept for 6 write/media endpoints; the dev `dev_admin_level` cookie that re-establishes
  "Set Admin Role Level" in the allow-list world (house should mirror); the send-code rate-limit FIX
  + LD's `created_at` NOT NULL twist; the `E2E_EXPOSE_OTP` escape hatch for e2e on `node build`; the
  vitest `$env/dynamic/private` alias; hand-adding jose to the lockfile.
- [media-upload.md](./media-upload.md) — LD-MEDIA: wiring media upload to real auth + GCS HMAC presigned
  PUT (legacy bucket, NOT R2); env names kept + `$env/dynamic/private` 503-when-unset; dev/prod bucket
  split via `import.meta.env.DEV`; testing without GCS (fake creds + puppeteer-intercepted PUT/lh3 +
  local PROCESS_IMAGE_URL stub, CORS-preflight gotcha, e2e photo-accumulation hygiene); THREE
  runes/sync bugs that blocked audio/media (SelectSpeaker `$derived`→`$state`, EditAudio `$bindable`
  fallback mismatch → `props_invalid_value`, and the sync dirty-clear race); and dropping the service
  worker to kill the deep-link 404.
- [dict-sync-invariants.md](./dict-sync-invariants.md) — LD-P4B audit of LD's per-dict sync engine
  against the three house local-first-editing bugs (cold-DB id collisions, missing local `users` FK
  row, unscoped cross-sector `DELETE FROM deletes`). All three are prevented by LD's architecture
  (loading-gate + cold-open `sync_now`; dict.db has no `users` FK; single-sector engine) — records the
  invariants to keep true so they stay prevented.
- [unocss-svelte-scoped-to-universal.md](./unocss-svelte-scoped-to-universal.md) — M2a plugin
  swap: the svelte-scoped defaults the universal plugin drops (directives transformer +
  Svelte `class:` extraction) and how to restore them; `@unocss/reset` becoming a direct dep AND
  needing a CSS cascade layer (else modal overlays go transparent from an equal-specificity tie);
  why svelte-pieces' pre-compiled CSS is unaffected; grep-based CSS parity checks; and using a
  headless browser on `node build`/throwaway `vite dev` to debug dev-only CSS.
