# /admin/analytics — dashboard improvement backlog

Deduped backlog of proposals from the `log-and-fix` daily review (Phase C). Reader:
`src/lib/db/server/log-analytics.ts`; page: `src/routes/admin/analytics/+page.svelte`; chart lib:
`$lib/charts/` (Bar/Combo/Line).

## Shipped (2026-06-26, `.issues/logging-buildout.md`)
- ✅ **Pipeline-health / ingestion-liveness strip** — last log / session_start / server log /
  retention + hot/archived counts; live vs "no ingestion in 24h" verdict.
- ✅ **Self-instrumentation event-coverage panel** — declared `ALL_TRACKED_EVENTS` vs seen/never.
- ✅ **Geo-transform health hint** — "CF location-headers transform appears OFF" when located but no coords.
- ✅ **Errors by build version** (current vs stale bundle) — ported from house.
- ✅ **Leader-worker DB health panel** — `live_query_*` timeouts/recovered/failed + had_leader/source split.

## Shipped (2026-06-27, `.issues/log-review-fixes-2026-06-26.md`)
- ✅ **Bot/headless exclusion across ALL usage+engagement+geo** — registered `is_bot_ua` SQLite fn +
  `HUMAN_ROWS_SQL` on daily/events/routes/source/users/perf/ttfb/web_vitals; bot-skip-first in the
  session loop (geo areas); cold rollup (`log-retention-cron.ts`) skips bot rows too for hot/cold
  consistency. Server rows (NULL UA) always kept; capability panel keeps its separate `bot_sessions`.
- ✅ **Core Web Vitals panel + reader agg** — `web_vitals` (p50/p75/p95 by LCP/INP/CLS/FCP/TTFB,
  human-only), p75 graded vs CWV thresholds, with a "no vitals despite N human sessions /
  headless-only" empty-state hint.

## Shipped (2026-06-28, `.issues/log-review-recommendations-2026-06-27.md`)
- ✅ **Deploy/version annotation markers on the daily timeline** — `log-analytics.ts` `deploys`
  (first-seen day per `app_version`, hot window, human rows); page maps to chart `events` (chip
  `⬆ HH:MM` + note with version/first-seen/sessions) on the Traffic ComboChart + Errors LineChart.
- ✅ **`page_load` percentile hygiene** — perf query filters `duration_ms > 0` (drops bfcache/instant
  0ms loads); `PerfSummary.slowest = { duration_ms, route }` (new `url_route` helper, inline-tested);
  perf panel shows a "slowest Ns · /route" row per metric.

## Shipped (2026-06-29, `.issues/log-review-followups-2026-06-29.md`)
- ✅ **`navigator.webdriver`-based automation exclusion (M1)** — `remote-log.ts` `enrich()` stamps
  `context.webdriver:true` on every row of an automated session; `log-analytics.ts` folds
  `coalesce(json_extract(context,'$.webdriver'),0)=1` into the audience filter (per-row) + the
  per-session bot check (capability/geo). Headed Playwright/Selenium now lands in Bots regardless of
  UA. **Cross-repo TODO: port to tutor.**
- ✅ **Per-route p95 performance (L2)** — `performance.by_route` groups page_load timings by
  normalized route (slowest p95 first); "Page load by route" table on the Performance panel.
- ✅ **`classify-error.ts` consolidation (M2)** — shared error-classification module; ingestion
  (`+error.svelte`) + analytics (`is_noise`) both route through it.
- ✅ **No-WebGL globe fallback + noise filter (L6)** — graceful fallback message + `warn`-level log
  folded into `KNOWN_NOISE_PATTERNS`.

## Open proposals
- **★ Geo-split Core Web Vitals (TTFB/LCP by region or distance-to-origin bucket)** *(filed 2026-06-30 —
  grounded in a real geo tax).* The shipped CWV panel aggregates p50/p75/p95 per metric across **all**
  geos, hiding that on 06-30 **64/65 sessions were Malaysia → Boston origin**, paying ~997ms page-load
  TTFB (vs 563ms US) and dragging LCP to ~2.8s (needs-improvement). Add a TTFB/LCP breakdown by
  `country`/`region` (or near/mid/far distance-to-Boston buckets, reusing the existing haversine),
  human-only, so the far-region tax is a standing signal instead of a hand-run query. LD-first; flag for
  house (also Boston-hosted).
- **Deploy-day errors fold** *(ported from house · 2026-06-30).* Tag errors from a **stale `app_version`**
  and/or **within N min of a deploy marker** so post-deploy stale-bundle spikes auto-explain instead of
  needing manual triage. LD already renders deploy markers on the timeline (shipped 06-28) and saw ~16
  app_versions in 7d, so this is the natural next layer; data is in `app_version` vs current build.
- **★ Schema-drift guard on the pipeline-health strip** *(filed 2026-06-29 — NEXT-TO-BUILD, grounded
  in a real P1).* Today's review caught a live `crash`: `/api/admin-sync` 500'd with `no such table:
  dictionary_partners` because the prod `shared.db` never got that table (the initial migration was
  consolidated *after* it was applied → see `.issues/missing-dictionary-partners-table-prod.md`). The
  dashboard would have pre-empted it: in `log-analytics.ts`, intersect `SELECT name FROM sqlite_master`
  with `SYNCABLE_TABLE_NAMES` and render any missing table in red on the health strip ("⚠ schema drift:
  `<table>` missing"). Cheap, and turns a user-hit 500 into a proactive ops signal. Extend to per-dict
  DBs once that's wired.
- **Leader-worker failures by SQLite result `code` + current-vs-stale build** *(ported from house,
  2026-06-29).* LD's leader-worker health panel (shipped 06-26) shows only timeout/recovered/failed +
  had_leader/source. Add a `code` histogram (label SQLite codes — 11=CORRUPT, 26=NOTADB…) and an
  `app_version` current-vs-stale split on the *failed* bucket, to distinguish "corruption on a stale
  build (self-heals on update)" from "RPC timeouts on the current build (a real regression)". Data is
  already in `context.code` + `app_version`.
- **Intent→shown success event** *(ported from house/tutor, 2026-06-29 — LOW until reader traffic).*
  Pair each open-intent event (`entry_opened` / `dictionary_opened`) with a "rendered" success event so
  analytics can measure the intent→shown gap and rank silently-degraded reads (live-query failures that
  open but never populate). Fits LD's event vocab; revisit when real contributor/visitor traffic lands.
- **Error-per-use by feature** *(ported from house, 2026-06-28 — LOW until real traffic)* — errors
  normalized by the matching usage event, to rank what's breaking relative to how much it's used.
- **Real session-duration distribution** (median/p90 from heartbeat span) + **events/session**,
  augmenting/replacing the proxy "Logs / session" engagement metric (had to compute the
  2198s-vs-~10s spread by hand in the 06-26 review). **Sharpened 2026-06-29:** make it
  **visibility-aware** — a single idle tab today emitted ~1,200 heartbeats over 11 h and would read as
  668 min of "engagement". Either gate heartbeats on `document.visibilityState` in `remote-log.ts`, or
  compute duration as the **active (visible) span** only.
- **True unique-visitor counts via a cookieless `visitor_hash`** (lifted from the retired
  `analytics-pipeline.md` — the one idea the house-port analytics didn't carry over). The shipped
  dashboard counts **sessions** (`session_id`), not long-lived visitors. To add real uniques:
  server-stamp `visitor_hash = sha256(cf-connecting-ip + '|' + user_agent + '|' + ANALYTICS_SALT)` at
  ingest in `insert-client-log.ts` (new nullable column + index), roll it up in
  `log-retention-cron.ts`. Decisions already made with Jacob: **per-app `ANALYTICS_SALT`** (hashes
  non-correlatable across LD/tutor/house), **NOT daily-rotated** (a visitor stays one id across days),
  **GDPR explicitly a non-concern** (no cookie/consent banner). Accepted tradeoffs: phone+laptop = 2
  visitors; NAT + same UA can collide. Good enough for traffic stats.

## Cross-pollination from sibling apps (house + tutor)
*Added 2026-06-27 (Phase D — first cross-repo read). LD is currently the furthest-along dashboard, so
the borrow list is short.*

- ✅ **Error-cluster + known-noise classification on the errors panel** *(ported from tutor — SHIPPED
  2026-06-27, commit b10f813e)* — `error_clusters` now groups by `message` + `substr(stack,1,200)`
  with n/users/first/last and tags `KNOWN_NOISE_PATTERNS` (`Network error for /api/log`, `Failed to
  fetch dynamically imported module`) via `is_noise`, excluded from the headline error count.
- **Error-audience real-user verdict card** *(ported from house — LOW for LD)* — house's
  `error_audience` shows a `real_user / anonymous / bot` split + a "0 real-user errors → all noise"
  verdict. LD's shipped `error_clusters` + `is_noise` + human-only usage already cover most of the
  intent; keep as low-priority.
- **"Expected response (401/403/404)" bucket** *(ported from house, filed 2026-06-27 — MOSTLY COVERED
  on LD)* — house adds an `expected` bucket to `error_audience` so prefetch/permission gates aren't
  counted as real-user errors. **LD already handles this at the source:** `+error.svelte` demotes
  401/403→warn and 404→info, so expected gates never reach the `error/crash` levels feeding
  `error_clusters`. Only revisit if LD later builds an `error_audience` panel.

*LD wins the siblings should borrow (flag in their reviews):* the **bot/headless exclusion across all
usage+geo metrics** (house only de-bots errors so far; tutor not at all), the **Core Web Vitals**
panel, and the **pipeline-liveness + event-coverage** strips.

*Skipped as inapplicable to LD:* tutor's **Mobile-health / memory-OOM** RN panel (web-only) and
house's **/admin/revenue** dashboard (no payments).
