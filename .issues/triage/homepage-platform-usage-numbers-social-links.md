Once we complete the migration, it would be great to show our impact numbers somewhere on a "counter" on the bottom or side of the homepage. we would like those numbers to update in real time.

**HOMEPAGE FOOTER**
- same size as current header (height)

- Add text: Living Dictionaries is a project of Living Tongues Institute for Endangered Languages. Total number of public Living Dictionaries: INSERT NUMBER. Total number of dictionary entries: INSERT NUMBER.

**Data sources**
- Number of public Living Dictionaries - from Supabase
- Total dictionary entries - from Supabase
- Total Visitors to the site - we need a 3rd party plug-in for this (TBD)

On the About page, we can flesh out more about the Impact of the project itself.

Under "About Living Dictionaries" we will insert a new heading called "Testimonials" and Anna will send the text + 1 image to Diego for display. 

- A heatmap of where people are visiting the platform (IP addresses) - needs plug-in
- Total number of dictionary editors - we need to figure out what exact numbers we want to share here. We have around 1k editors, but many of them only did on entry a long time ago. Is there a way to check how many times a person has logged in or how many entries have they added or edited?
- dashboard that has the same as the homepage counter, and other usage numbers?
- featured Living Dictionary of the month?
