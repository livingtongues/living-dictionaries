It would be great if the first image uploaded to a dictionary entry appears as the entry's featured image in SEO. thanks. Right now only the Living Tongues logo is appearing as the featured image. The way it was configured before (with little globe, name of entry, name of language) when we shared entries on social media was great. This is how it currently looks when shared:
