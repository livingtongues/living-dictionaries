Hello Living Dictionaries team,
We are preparing a community-authorized upload for the Catawba Living Dictionary.
At present, the Living Dictionaries web contact form returns a 500 error, and the published intake email address bounces (DNS failure).
Could you please advise the correct contact or intake pathway for dictionary uploads, or redirect this request internally?
Thank you, and with appreciation for the platform.

Thohahènte
