title: End-of-sentence periods in sample sentences for RTL languages like Hebrew

I have a question:  The dictionary displays the end-of-sentence periods on the right side of the sentence. This is good for LTR languages such as English but not for RTL languages like Hebrew. Could you somehow cause these periods to be displayed on the left side of Hebrew sentences?

Thank you so much,
