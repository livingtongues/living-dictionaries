title: Sengwer alphabetical order

This is a low-priority topic that can be done in 2023 when we have time to assess things like customizing alphabetization for projects, or providing search links that yield a list for each letter in an alphabet.

The Sengwer language uses its own alphabetical order that is different than the conventional order. The community has requested that we help them display their data in the order below, but they are in no rush to see it implemented. I explained to them it would be sometime in the future because we don't currently have this ability.

A note from the dictionary author: "Just in case you are interested, the next bit is a short explanation of the alphabet order. Vowels marked with a macron are [-ATR] counterparts of unmarked vowels (in Sengwer “light” vowels). Though there is five  [-ATR] vowels only three are marked in the orthography. Tone is also unmarked though vowels have a threeway tone contrast (unmarked, low, high). 

Prenasalised consonants are digraphs which count as separate letters in the alphabet (MB, ND, NG, NJ) as do the velar and palatal nasals NG’ and NY. It is only in these digraphs that the voiced consonants graphemes B, D, G, and J appear and they are not considered letters of the Sengwer alphabet on their own."
