# E2E / deep-flow testing — puppeteer-core + system Chrome

We drive a real browser with **puppeteer-core** pointed at the **already-installed Chrome**
(`chrome-launcher`'s `getChromePath()`), so there's **no per-version browser download** — the same
engine `svelte-look` and the `browser-tools` skill use. (Playwright was removed for this reason.)

## Run

```bash
pnpm -F site build            # produce build/ once (the script will auto-build if missing)
pnpm -F site test:flow        # boots its own `node build`, runs the flow, tears down
```

Point at an already-running server (skips booting):

```bash
BASE_URL=http://localhost:3041 pnpm -F site test:flow
PORT=3097 pnpm -F site test:flow            # change the self-booted server's port (default 3095)
```

Exit code is non-zero on any failed assertion. Screenshots land in `e2e/screenshots/` (git-ignored).

## What `dev-flow.mjs` covers
A logged-in **mock manager** (`can_edit`) exercises the full editor: entries list (count read
from the server DB, so the fixture can grow) → open an entry overlay → edit the phonetic field via
its EditFieldModal → add a sense → delete that sense → assert the original survives.

The fixture is the local-only **`dev` "Dev Playground" dictionary** (slug doesn't exist in prod —
seeded by `pnpm -F site seed:dev-fixture`, which registers the catalog row + the non-admin
`dev-manager@example.com` manager and copies the legacy achi.db content into
`.data/dictionaries/dev.db` on first run). `pnpm -F site seed:variety` adds ~18 `demo_*`
entries covering the entries-list design space (definitions, multi-sense, media, orthographies,
homographs).

## M4 SQLite-read flows
- `test:catalog` (`catalog-sqlite.mjs`) — the dictionary catalog reads from `shared.db`: API
  public/private counts, the `/dictionaries` list, dict detail resolution, unknown-slug redirect.
- `review-shots.mjs` (`node e2e/review-shots.mjs`) — quick visual pass: screenshots `/`,
  `/dictionaries`, `/<dict>/entries`, `/<dict>/about` into `e2e/review/` (git-ignored) for eyeballing.
  (A `test:entries` / `entries-sqlite.mjs` flow existed but targeted the removed
  `/api/dictionaries/[id]/entries-data` endpoint — deleted 2026-07-12; entries reads are covered
  by `test:flow` + the snapshot-read flows.)
- The catalog flow **filters known-external console errors** (Mapbox tile 403s in headless, the
  entries-worker CDN-cache 403) so the pageerror assertion reflects the conversion, not ambient noise.
- Needs `site/.data` seeded (shared.db + per-dict dbs from the example; `VACUUM INTO` for clean copies).

## Markdown editor flow
- `test:markdown` (`markdown-editor-flow.mjs`, dict `local-mquh8w6n`) — the CKEditor→Tiptap
  migration regression: HTML-era `about` renders through the read shim → Edit converts to
  markdown in the Tiptap editor (underline dropped) → Save persists MARKDOWN → notes modal
  mounts Tiptap → **Keyman** (Assamese) maps physical keystrokes into the ProseMirror →
  markdown notes render rich + sync to the server dict db.
- Boots `vite dev`, NOT `node build`: a bare local prod server has no snapshot source for dict
  DBs (no R2 env, no dev-vps fallback), so **dict-route client layout loads hang and those pages
  never hydrate** — anything clicking around a dict route locally must run against dev.

## Authoring more flows — the workflow
1. **Explore** with the `browser-tools` skill (interactive CDP on `:9222`) to discover selectors.
2. **Codify** the deep/repeatable path here as a puppeteer-core script with real `waitForFunction`
   waits + assertions, so it becomes a one-command regression instead of many agent turns.

### Gotchas baked into the script (reuse them)
- **Svelte-bound inputs:** `input.value = x` won't trip reactivity. Use the native setter
  (`Object.getOwnPropertyDescriptor(HTMLInputElement.prototype,'value').set.call(input, x)`) then
  dispatch `input` + `change`.
- Prefer `page.waitForFunction(() => document.body.innerText.includes(…))` over fixed sleeps.
- The dev server (`:3041`) is usually Jacob's already-running `pnpm dev` (you may start it if not);
  point `BASE_URL` at it, or boot your own `node build` (this script does) for an isolated agent run.
  Note: media-upload + the `dev_admin_level` toggle are DEV-gated, so they only work against `pnpm dev`.
- At M4+ (real auth), log in once and reuse puppeteer's `storageState` / cookies to start deep.
