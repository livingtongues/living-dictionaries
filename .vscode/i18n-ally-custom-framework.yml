# An array of strings which contain Language Ids defined by VS Code
# You can check available language ids here: https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/languages/identifiers
languageIds:
  - javascript
  - typescript
  - svelte

# An array of RegExes to find the key usage. **The key should be captured in the first match group**.
# You should unescape RegEx strings in order to fit in the YAML file
# To help with this, you can use https://www.freeformatter.com/json-escape.html
usageMatchRegex:
  - "[^\\w\\d]t\\(['\"`]({key})['\"`]" # i18n-ally's default example of how to detect `t("your.i18n.keys")` - the `{key}` will be placed by a proper keypath matching regex, you can ignore it and use your own matching rules as well
  # - "[^\w\d]i18n\.(.+?)[^\w\.]" # 👈 use this if you want to match the alternative direct method demoed in this repo, as in `$page.data.i18n.hello.world`

# If set to true, only enables this custom framework (will disable all built-in frameworks)
