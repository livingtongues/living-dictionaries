description: Daily read-and-recommend client_logs review for Living Dictionaries. Reads all client/server logs from the VPS logs.db (rollups in shared.db), triages errors, paints the usage/perf/geo/health picture, scours the codebase for missing logging, proposes /admin/analytics improvements, and writes a dated report of action-steps. NEVER edits code.

# Log Review & Coverage Loop (Living Dictionaries)

LD runs **no** third-party analytics or error tracking — `client_logs` in the VPS `logs.db` is the
*only* window into what users do and what breaks. This command is our "Google Analytics + Sentry
without the cruft": read everything logged, make smart decisions from it, and find where we're flying
blind. You are also my advisor on how to improve this command + our logging.

> **This command NEVER edits code.** Read-only investigation + recommendations. Everything actionable
> becomes an action item in the dated report or a new `.issues/` file — safe to run unattended.
>
> **⚠️ Verify every recommendation against the CURRENT code before you write it down.** This review
> repeatedly proposes things that are *already implemented*, which erodes trust in the whole report.
> Before any candidate becomes an action item (Phase B coverage gaps, Phase C dashboard features,
> Phase D sibling borrows), grep/read the actual source — the `log-analytics.ts` reader, the
> `/admin/analytics` page, `remote-log.ts`, the server hooks (`hooks.server.ts`), and whatever
> component/route the item touches — and confirm it isn't already done. If it already exists, do NOT
> list it as an open action item: either drop it or record it as `✅ already in code (verified)`.
>
> **Deploy target:** the `living` VPS serves the apex `livingdictionaries.app` from `main`
> (cutover completed 2026-07). Review the VPS `client_logs`.

## Four phases, one report

| Phase | What | Output |
|---|---|---|
| **A — Inspect** | Read the logs on the server; triage + summarize (errors / usage / perf+geo / health) | Findings + action items |
| **B — Scour** | Walk the codebase for important paths that *should* log but don't (informed by A) | Prioritized coverage suggestions |
| **C — Sharpen** | Look at `/admin/analytics` with fresh eyes given the now-larger dataset | ≥1 concrete improvement proposal |
| **D — Cross-pollinate** | End step: borrow recent dashboard wins from the sibling apps (house + tutor) | Ported backlog items |

All four write into a single dated report: **`.cron/log-reviews/YYYY-MM-DD.md`**, then a short chat
summary. B, C and D are read-and-recommend — they propose, they don't build.

## Default scope

- **Window:** last **24h**, all levels — but always render **7-day** and **30-day** trend context.
- **Filter `build_target='production'`** to drop local/preview test noise where it helps.
- **Overridable** by the invocation ("last 7 days", "only errors", a `user_id`). Honor it.

## Background — how logs get here

`site/src/lib/debug/remote-log.ts` (init'd once from `+layout.svelte` `onMount`) hooks `window.error`
/ `unhandledrejection`, patches `console.error`, emits heartbeats (30s) + `session_start` (carries
`db_tier` + `db_caps` capability telemetry) + `visibility_*`, and exposes `log_event()` / `track()` /
`track_timing()` / `track_web_vital()` / `log_navigation()`. Buffered in
`localStorage.debug_log_pending`, flushed every 5s via `POST /api/log` and on `pagehide` via
`sendBeacon`. Server `insert_client_log()` writes to **`logs.db`.client_logs** (split out of
shared.db 2026-07-05), stamping `source` + approximate Cloudflare geo. The forever
`log_daily_metrics(day, metric, source, value)` + `log_daily_sessions` rollups (in **shared.db**) +
`/admin/analytics` (admin-gated, `log-analytics.ts`, watermark rollup-forward) give the aggregate
picture. `client_logs` is server-only (never syncs).

Key columns: `received_at` (server ISO, indexed DESC — ORDER BY this), `client_time`, `level`
(`error|warn|info|unhandled_rejection|crash`), `message`/`stack` (clamped 2k/16k), `url`,
`user_agent`, `platform`, `app_version`, `build_target`, `source` (`client|server`; NULL legacy =
client), `user_id` (nullable), **`session_id` (real column since 2026-07-05 — filter/group on this,
not `json_extract`)**, `country`/`region`/`city`/`latitude`/`longitude` (CF geo),
`context` (JSON: `breadcrumbs[]`, `db_tier`, `webdriver`, per-event extras). Analytics events store
the stable event name (`log-events.ts`: `search_performed`, `dictionary_opened`, `entry_opened`,
`audio_played`) as `message` on an `info` row.

## Querying prod — SSH + `docker exec`, read-only

`sqlite3` is NOT on the VPS host. Query through the primary **`sveltekit_blue`** container via
`better-sqlite3` (the VPS runs blue/green since 2026-06-24 — no plain `sveltekit` container; `_green`
is the standby sharing the same `/data` mount, fine for read-only queries too).

- **Container DB paths:** raw `client_logs` → **`/data/logs.db`**; rollups (`log_daily_*`) + `users`
  etc → `/data/shared.db` (`DATA_DIR=/data`). Always open `{ readonly: true }`. To join client_logs
  against shared.db tables (e.g. `users`), open logs.db and `db.exec("ATTACH '/data/shared.db' AS shared")`.
- **Escaping:** write the query to a local temp `.js` and pipe it through stdin:

```bash
cat > /tmp/lq.js <<'EOF'
const db = require('better-sqlite3')('/data/logs.db', { readonly: true })
const since = new Date(Date.now() - 24*60*60*1000).toISOString()
// ...query...
console.log(JSON.stringify(rows, null, 2))
EOF
ssh living 'docker exec -i sveltekit_blue node' < /tmp/lq.js
```

(See the **database** skill's production-VPS section for the canonical pattern + safety rules,
`debug-vps.md` for server/deploy issues.)

---

## Phase A — Inspect the logs

### A1. Errors & crashes

**Cluster** so one user hitting an error 50× is one row. Group by `message` + first 200 chars of `stack`:

```js
const db = require('better-sqlite3')('/data/logs.db', { readonly: true })
const since = new Date(Date.now() - 24*60*60*1000).toISOString()
const rows = db.prepare(`
  SELECT message, substr(coalesce(stack,''),1,200) stack_head,
         COUNT(*) n, MIN(received_at) first_seen, MAX(received_at) last_seen,
         COUNT(DISTINCT user_id) users, COUNT(DISTINCT app_version) versions
  FROM client_logs
  WHERE received_at >= ? AND level IN ('error','unhandled_rejection','crash')
  GROUP BY message, stack_head ORDER BY n DESC, last_seen DESC
`).all(since)
console.log(JSON.stringify(rows, null, 2))
```

**Drill** a cluster — pull the most recent full instance, then replay the session by
`session_id` (real column) ORDER BY received_at to reconstruct breadcrumbs + routes.
**Investigate** in the codebase (grep the message + symbols). **Recommend a fix — do NOT apply it.**

> **⚠️ Before recommending (or applying) ANY fix, check whether it's ALREADY FIXED.** Jacob creates and
> fixes many bugs during the day, so a logged error's root cause may already be patched by the time the
> review runs. Take the error's **timestamp / `app_version`** (the version is a build epoch-ms —
> `new Date(Number(app_version))`) and check `git log` since then: `git log --oneline -S <symbol> -- <path>`,
> read the offending code as it stands NOW, and confirm the crash still reproduces / the code is still
> unguarded. If a commit already resolves it (the message/diff matches the crash), **note it as
> `✅ already fixed (commit <sha>, verified)` and SKIP the fix** — don't propose redundant defense-in-depth
> unless there's a distinct reason. This applies equally when acting on an approved fix from a prior report.

**Severity rubric:** 🔴 P1 = `crash` / many distinct users / blocks a core flow (dictionary/entry/
search/audio/auth). 🟠 P2 = recurring `error`, single feature, has a workaround. 🟡 P3 = low-freq /
one user / cosmetic. ⚪ noise = expected/3rd-party/transient — name it so it filters next run.

### A2. Usage & engagement

The GA half. Distinct sessions & users (24h/7d/30d), median & p90 session duration (span of
heartbeats per `session_id` — real column), top routes (`message='navigation'`, `json_extract(context,'$.to')` →
the `dictionaries`/`about`/`account`/… buckets), top analytics events (`search_performed`,
`dictionary_opened`, `entry_opened`, `audio_played`), platform/version split. Call out surprises.

**Who's doing what — name the admins, keep everyone else generic.** Join `client_logs.user_id` →
`users.email` and split the active population in two:

- **Admins (named) — the part Jacob most wants in the brief.** Resolve each active user against the
  allow-list (`site/src/lib/admins.ts` `ADMINS`, email→name; level via
  `site/src/lib/server/resolve-admin-level.ts`) and paint a one-line narrative per admin who was on:
  *when* + for *how long*, *which admin/manager tools* they used (entry edits, audio/photo uploads,
  dictionary settings, import, messages), and anything notable — errors hit, an unusually long editing
  session, or a first appearance after a gap. Cover the whole LD team (everyone in `ADMINS`: Jacob,
  Diego, …).
- **Everyone else (generic / aggregate) — never named.** Dictionary contributors and public visitors
  stay anonymous: counts (new vs returning), top routes / feature events, and *anonymous* notable
  sessions. Do NOT identify individual non-admin users.

```js
// Per-user activity for the 24h window; tag admins by email, aggregate the rest.
// client_logs is in logs.db; users is in shared.db → ATTACH to join across files.
const db = require('better-sqlite3')('/data/logs.db', { readonly: true })
db.exec("ATTACH '/data/shared.db' AS shared")
const since = new Date(Date.now() - 24*60*60*1000).toISOString()
const rows = db.prepare(`
  SELECT cl.user_id, u.email,
         COUNT(*) events,
         COUNT(DISTINCT cl.session_id) sessions,
         MIN(cl.received_at) first_seen, MAX(cl.received_at) last_seen,
         GROUP_CONCAT(DISTINCT json_extract(cl.context,'$.to')) routes
  FROM client_logs cl LEFT JOIN shared.users u ON u.id = cl.user_id
  WHERE cl.received_at >= ? AND cl.user_id IS NOT NULL
  GROUP BY cl.user_id ORDER BY events DESC
`).all(since)
// Narrate rows whose email is in ADMINS (site/src/lib/admins.ts) BY NAME; summarize the rest in
// aggregate only (never name a non-admin).
console.log(JSON.stringify(rows, null, 2))
```

### A3. Performance & geography

- **Perf:** where `message='perf'` (carries `context.name` + `context.duration_ms`, plus web vitals
  under `context.name='web_vital'`), summarize p50/p90/p95 by `name` (`page_load`, `search`) vs the
  7/30-day trend. Page-load TTFB rides in `context.ttfb`.
- **Geo:** top areas by sessions (`country`/`region`), and **TTFB by distance to the Boston origin**
  (haversine of `latitude`/`longitude` → distance). This is the geo-split RUM — call out if
  far-region users pay a large TTFB tax (distance from Boston ≈ TTFB; LD is Boston-hosted like house).
- **Capability:** `session_start.context.db_tier` distribution (`opfs-worker` / `idb-worker` /
  `idb-main`) + any below-capability (Safari < 15.4) sessions that can't run the leader-worker DB.

### A4. Health & housekeeping

Total rows, daily volume + growth, oldest `received_at` vs **retention status** (the cron always runs
on the active node — verify `db_metadata.log_retention_ran_at` is recent and oldest row ≤14d), DB
size, heartbeat/noise ratio.

### A5. Host resources (past 24h)

The box self-reports whole-machine CPU/RAM/swap/disk every 5 min as `host_stats` server events
(`$lib/server/host-stats.ts` + `host-stats-cron.ts`; same rows feed the `/admin/health` "Host
resources" panel). Each `cpu_pct` is the **true average over its 5-min window** (diffed cumulative
`/proc/stat` counters — bursts inside the window can't hide), so max(cpu_pct) = the hottest 5-min
window of the day.

```js
const db = require('better-sqlite3')('/data/logs.db', { readonly: true })
const since = new Date(Date.now() - 24*60*60*1000).toISOString()
const rows = db.prepare(`
  SELECT context FROM client_logs
  WHERE received_at >= ? AND message='host_stats' AND source='server'
  ORDER BY received_at
`).all(since).map(r => JSON.parse(r.context))
const nums = k => rows.map(r => r[k]).filter(v => typeof v === 'number')
const avg = a => a.length ? +(a.reduce((s,v)=>s+v,0)/a.length).toFixed(1) : null
const max = a => a.length ? Math.max(...a) : null
console.log(JSON.stringify({
  samples: rows.length, // expect ~288; big gaps = cron/standby problem, flag it
  cpu_avg: avg(nums('cpu_pct')), cpu_hottest_5min: max(nums('cpu_pct')),
  load1_max: max(nums('load1')),
  mem_avg: avg(nums('mem_pct')), mem_max: max(nums('mem_pct')),
  swap_max_pct: max(nums('swap_pct')), swap_used_mb_last: rows.at(-1)?.swap_used_mb,
  disk_pct_now: rows.at(-1)?.disk_pct,
}, null, 2))
```

Write a **short snippet** (3-5 lines) into the report's `## Host resources` section: headline
verdict ("plenty of headroom" / "watch X" / "act on X"), CPU avg + hottest 5-min window, RAM
avg/max + swap, disk %. **Flag as an action item if:** disk ≥ 80%, swap % rising day-over-day,
`load1_max` sustained above core count (2), the hottest-window CPU repeatedly pinned near 100,
RAM creeping up vs the prior days (leak), or sample count far below ~288 (telemetry gap).
Otherwise keep it to the calm one-liner — this section exists so a bad trend gets caught weeks
early, not to pad the report.

---

## Phase B — Scour the codebase for missing logging

Informed by Phase A: where did a user clearly do something or hit something we *couldn't see*?
Recommend (don't add) the event/level/fields each should emit.

**Inventory:** client user-flows (dictionary browse, entry edit, search, audio, account,
create-dictionary), every `src/routes/api/*/+server.ts` failure path (auth/OTP, admin-sync,
messages/email-inbound, uploads), background jobs (R2 snapshot cron), the sync engine (push/pull
failures, conflict resolution), and server-side gaps that today only hit ephemeral `docker logs`
(convert to `log_server_event`). For each: **path → event name → level → fields → why it's worth it
(or why it's noise).** Prioritize by "would this have answered a question we couldn't answer in A?".

**Emission convention (use this shape):** `track({ event, props })` for analytics (event from the
`$lib/debug/log-events.ts` vocab), `log_event({ level, message, context })` for handled warnings/
errors, `track_timing({ name, duration_ms })` for slow ops, `log_server_event({ level, message,
error?, context })` server-side (`source='server'`). `console.error` stays patched; `console.warn`/
`info`/`log` stay DEV-ONLY.

---

## Phase C — Sharpen the dashboard

`/admin/analytics` (admin-gated, `log-analytics.ts`) turns the logs into decisions — usage / perf /
geo / health from `log_daily_metrics` + live `client_logs`, merged hot+cold per day. It should get
**more useful every week** as data accumulates — that only happens if someone keeps pushing it.
**Each run, study it and propose ≥1 concrete improvement** (never "looks fine"); write the idea into
the report + append to a deduped backlog **`.issues/future/dashboard-improvements.md`** (create if
missing). Build nothing. Lenses: what did I compute by hand here that the page should just show? what
trend is legible now that wasn't? what's noisy/misleading? Spot-check a headline number vs your raw
query — drift means a bug to file. The reusable chart lib is `$lib/charts/` (Bar/Combo/Line).

> **What the admin DASHBOARDS are FOR — aggregate stability/health, NOT individual-error triage.**
> The `/admin/analytics` + `/admin/health` dashboards exist to answer **aggregate health/stability**
> questions at a glance: *is error volume trending up or down? is the CURRENT build clean? are the
> subsystems (OPFS/leader-worker DB, sync, boot, retention cron, uptime) working for essentially
> EVERYONE?* They are health/trend/subsystem-working-for-all instruments — **not** scrollable lists of
> individual errors to page through. **Triaging individual errors is THIS log-review session's job** —
> that's what the `logs.db` cluster/drill/session-replay queries above are for. So when proposing Phase
> C/D dashboard features, **favor health / stability / trend / "subsystem is working for everyone"
> panels** (rates, current-vs-stale splits, distinct-affected counts, loop/breadth flags, pipeline
> liveness) and **avoid per-error-list features** — a raw feed of individual errors belongs in the
> log-parsing scripts here, not on the dashboard.

---

## Phase D — Cross-pollinate across the three apps (end step)

LD, **house** (`~/code/house`) and **tutor** (`~/code/tutor`) share the same analytics architecture —
`client_logs` + the `log_daily_metrics` rollup, `log-analytics.ts`, `/admin/analytics`, and the
`$lib/charts/` lib — so a dashboard improvement built in one almost always ports to the others. This
end step is what keeps the three reviews *compounding* instead of drifting apart.

As the **final step each run**, read the other two apps' recent dashboard work and decide what to
borrow:

1. Their last few **`.cron/log-reviews/*.md`** (focus on the Phase C / dashboard sections) — what did
   they just sharpen?
2. Their **`.issues/future/dashboard-improvements.md`** backlog — both the *shipped* ✅ items and the
   *open* proposals.
3. If a backlog entry is too terse to judge, skim their **`site/src/lib/db/server/log-analytics.ts`**
   + analytics `+page.svelte` to see the actual panel/metric they built.

For each improvement the siblings recently shipped or proposed, judge **"does it fit LD?"** Skip the
clearly-inapplicable — e.g. tutor's RN **Mobile-health / memory-OOM** panel and house's
**/admin/revenue** dashboard (LD is web-only with no payments). For the ones that fit, **append them
to `.issues/future/dashboard-improvements.md`** tagged `ported from <app>`, and note them in the
report's §6. Read-and-recommend — **build nothing here.**

Symmetry: if LD *just shipped* a panel the siblings lack, call it out in the report so the house +
tutor reviews pick it up next run — their reviews read LD's backlog/reports the same way. (LD is
currently the furthest-along dashboard; recent LD-only wins worth flagging for the siblings: the
**bot/headless exclusion across *all* usage+geo metrics**, the **Core Web Vitals** panel, and the
**pipeline-liveness + event-coverage** strips. A standing thing to borrow back: tutor's
**error-cluster + known-noise** classification, which LD's raw `recent_errors` still lacks.)

---

## Output

1. **Write `.cron/log-reviews/YYYY-MM-DD.md`** (create the folder if missing). **If a digest already exists for today** (a manual + scheduled run, or a catch-up re-run after downtime), **append a new `# Log review — YYYY-MM-DD (run N · HH:MM UTC)` section rather than overwriting it** — never clobber an earlier run's memory:

```markdown
# Log review — YYYY-MM-DD (new.livingdictionaries.app · window: last 24h)

## TL;DR
- <3-5 bullets: health verdict, top issue, top opportunity>

## 1. Errors & crashes
<clusters by severity, each with root-cause hypothesis + action item>

## 2. Usage & engagement
<sessions/users 24h·7d·30d, durations, top routes/events, surprises.
**Who's doing what:** a named line per active ADMIN (when, how long, which admin/manager tools,
anything notable) + a generic/anonymous picture of everyone else — never name individual non-admins.>

## 3. Performance & geography
<timings where logged; geo areas + TTFB-by-distance; capability mix; slow-path gaps for Phase B>

## 4. Health & housekeeping
<volume, growth, db size, retention status, noise>

## Host resources (past 24h)
<3-5 lines from A5: verdict + CPU avg/hottest-window, RAM+swap, disk %. Flags become action items.>

## 5. Coverage gaps (Phase B)
<prioritized: path → event → level → fields → why>

## 6. Dashboard improvements (Phase C + D)
<≥1 concrete proposal for /admin/analytics; link the backlog items you'd prioritize. Then Phase D:
sibling-app (house/tutor) wins worth borrowing + any LD win the siblings should take.>

## Recommendations / action items
- [ ] <each as a checkbox; link new .issues/ files>

## Trend context (7d / 30d)
<daily counts table or sparkline data>
```

2. **The report FILE is the artifact — follow the shared contract** at
   `~/code/horse/.cron/report-style.md`: fully self-contained (a reader never opens this session),
   no unexpanded abbreviations, **MDX + charts encouraged** (this loop sits on rich data — small
   inline-SVG charts of error/usage/perf trends travel all the way to Jacob's phone via the morning
   debrief). The **Who's doing what** human picture — a line per active admin *by name*, then one
   or two lines of aggregate, **unnamed** activity for everyone else — goes IN the report. Chat
   close-out: a few lines + the report path (the morning debrief and Jacob read the file, not this
   transcript).
